//This is an iterator object that attaches to an array. Use the procedure
//AttachArray to attach an array variable. Then the Iterator interface is
//available for the array by using the cArrayIterator object.
//The class is abstract, and needs to be instantiated by using the various
//array type subclasses, e.g. cArrayIteratorString, cArrayIteratorInteger
